<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> I am a self-starter and a keen individual in the sphere of how technology relates to business. With a strong focus on the fundamental field of computer science, I have broadened my scope by attending/enrolling in numerous internships which range from drone technology to the integration of technology into the real estate and hospitality industry. 
My passion in data science started with the realisation that the entire system with which we operate in, relies on data. We turn to data optimization to address humanityâ€™s greatest challenges. I aim to harness powerful open source platforms such as GitHub to produce collaborative solutions with my fellow peers. Equipped with Java, JavaScript ad Python programming skills I have learned the backbone of Android and web application development.</p>
